# Mobile Game Churn Prediction Dashboard

## Overview
This project is a **Streamlit-based interactive dashboard** for analyzing mobile game churn data. The dashboard allows users to explore key game metrics, visualize player behavior, and predict churn probability using a trained machine learning model.

## Features
- 📊 **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Interactive charts and insights on player behavior.
- 🔍 **Level-Based Analysis**: Select and analyze different game levels.
- 🎯 **Churn Prediction Model**: Predicts whether a player will churn based on selected parameters.
- ⚡ **User-Friendly Interface**: Built with **Streamlit** for ease of use.

## Usage
- Select different game levels and player segments.
- View success/fail attempts, average duration, and other metrics.
- Input player data to get churn predictions.

## Deployment
The project is deployed on **Streamlit Cloud**. You can access it [here](https://mobile-game-churn.streamlit.app/).
